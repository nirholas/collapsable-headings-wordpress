## Pure CSS/HTML Div

Wordpress without plugins can be an exhuasting effort.  After being assigned a project with limited plugins, I had to search for a solution using pure CSS & HTML.

I have found that <' summary '> and <' detail '>' tags are perfect for headings. There is not any CSS required as the collapsing and showing are part of the tags definition/formatting. We will cover CSS later...

Example:

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/auz3ge8e/1/embed/html/"></script>



<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/resende4/aaxh0zd5/2/embedded/result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


## Looking for something better?

We can use CSS and additonal HTML to achieve a more professional look. 

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/resende4/uoy6mf2h/1/embedded/html/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/resende4/uoy6mf2h/1/embedded/css/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/resende4/uoy6mf2h/1/embedded/result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
